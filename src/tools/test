The<em> Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy has imprinted images of New Zealand into the minds of millions. The epic proportions of the film are perfectly enhanced by the epic proportions of New Zealand\'s landscape. </p><p>This is a country for adventure sports and photo cameras. <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/North_Island_(New_Zealand)/">North Island\'s</a> bubbling volcanic peaks and <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/South_Island_(New_Zealand)/">South Island\'s</a> Southern Alps are a hiker\'s paradise. Or, if you prefer, they\'re also the perfect playground for bungee jumping, skiing, spelunking and much more. </p><p>New Zealand\'s attractions are not limited to natural beauty. Urban New Zealand is characterized by vibrant Maori culture and tasteful <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Europe/">European</a> modernism. Cities like <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Wellington/">Wellington</a> and <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Auckland/">Auckland</a> are not glamorous, but have a strong aesthetic appeal backed up by the surrounding landscape. Each town has a distinct and unique characteristic dependent on its history. No two places feel quite the same. Locations around the country have been used by many film makers to portray other countries around the world.  Its climate is diverse and the wildlife is unique.</p></div><p class="screen_only"><a class="link_to_top" href="#"><img src="http://1.tpstc.com/img/arrow-green-up.gif" alt="Top"></a></p><div id="Brief_History"><span class="section_edit_link"><a href="/wiki_edit.cfm?title=New%5FZealand&amp;section=Brief%20History" title="Edit section: Brief History" rel="nofollow">edit</a> </span><h2>Brief History</h2><p>New Zealand was settled by <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Polynesia/" rel="nofollow">Polynesians</a> somewhere between the 11th and 14th century. These original settlers are known as M\u0101ori. M\u0101ori legends are wild and fierce. They are influenced by the countries untamed beauty and raw volcanic power. M\u0101ori are a warrior race and tribal traditions still feature strongly despite outside influences. The most visible M\u0101ori tradition is the Haka, a challenge made famous by its use by New Zealand rugby and rugby league teams.</p><p>The first Europeans to arrive in New Zealand were led by Dutchman Abel Tasman, who anchored in Golden Bay, at the northern end of <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/South_Island_(New_Zealand)/">South Island</a> in December 1642. After a clash with local M\u0101ori, he moved on to Tonga. He did, however, sketch the west coasts of the two major islands and named them <em>Staten Landt</em>, after the States-General of the <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Netherlands/">Netherlands</a>. That name was later changed to <em>Nova Zeelandia</em> by Dutch cartographers, who named it after the Dutch province of Zeeland. </p><p>More than a hundred years after Tasman\'s visit, Captain James Cook visited the islands and was the first to circumnavigate them. Various whaling, sealing and trading ships visited the islands from the 1790s onwards, offering European goods for M\u0101ori supplies and services.</p><p>In 1840, a treaty was signed between M\u0101ori chiefs and the <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/United_Kingdom/">British</a>, which brought New Zealand into the British Empire and gave M\u0101ori the same rights as British citizens. Land quickly became an issue in the following decades, eventually leading to the loss of much of the native land through wars and bureaucracy. This treaty is known as the Treaty of Waitangi and was signed on the 6th February 1840. This date is still celebrated as a public holiday.</p><p>In the early 20th century, the economy was highly regulated and an extensive welfare state emerged. During the World Wars, New Zealand, as part of the British Empire, committed significant numbers of troops to fight alongside Britain. New Zealand\'s national remembrance day to commemorate those lives lost in the wars is on the 25th April (ANZAC Day).</p><p>In the 1950s, M\u0101ori were moving to the cities in large numbers. This developed into a protest movement, which led to better race-relations in the late 20th century. Towards the end of the 20th century, the economy became increasingly deregulated. Foreign policy became more independent, rather than following the lead from Britain or the <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/United_States/" rel="nofollow">United States</a>. Although still within the commonwealth New Zealand has been growing culturally, economically and politically apart from Britain since the 1950\'s. </p><p>In the 1980\'s New Zealand became a nuclear free zone prohibiting the manufacture or possession of any nuclear weapons or nuclear powered vessels. At the time this caused a major rift between New Zealand and the <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/United_States/" rel="nofollow">United States</a>, and even today this limits the contact between the two countries. The legislation is the only one like it in the world and has become a political milestone and a symbol for green activists throughout the world.</p></div><p class="screen_only"><a class="link_to_top" href="#"><img src="http://1.tpstc.com/img/arrow-green-up.gif" alt="Top"></a></p><div id="Geography"><span class="section_edit_link"><a href="/wiki_edit.cfm?title=New%5FZealand&amp;section=Geography" title="Edit section: Geography" rel="nofollow">edit</a> </span><h2>Geography</h2><p>New Zealand is one of the southernmost countries in the world, with the Tasman Sea to the west, the South <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Pacific_Ocean/" rel="nofollow">Pacific Ocean</a> to the east ans the Southern Ocean directly south of the country. It consists of two main islands: the volcanic and subtropical <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/North_Island_(New_Zealand)/">North Island</a> and the <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/South_Island_(New_Zealand)/">South Island</a>, with snow capped mountains and fjords. In between lies the 30-kilometre-wide <strong>Cook Strait</strong>. The highest summit is <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Mount_Cook/">Mount Cook</a> on the South Island at over 3,700 metres. Lake Taupo on the North Island is the largest body of water in the country. To the south of the South Island is the third main island, <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Stewart_Island/">Stewart Island</a>.  It is much smaller and predominately a national park. It can be visited by boat or plane and is a good place to spot the elusive Kiwi bird (mostly during the night), the national symbol of the country. </p><p>The extreme north of the North Island is subtropical with magnificent beaches and the Bay of Islands. There are sand dunes here unlike anything to be seen in the rest of the country. The far north is also home to the unique Kauri trees some of which are over 1500 years old and 5 metres in diameter. In the centre of the island are the volcanic region of <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Tongariro_National_Park/">Tongariro National Park</a>, with its three summits <strong>Ruapehu, Ngauruhoe and Tongariro</strong>, also featured in the Lord of the Rings movies. <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Rotorua/">Rotorua</a> is a good place to see volcanic and geothermal activities as well, as mud pools are just below the surface and occasionally some eruptions do occur. When not causing eruptions however the volcanic activity is a source for hot thermal spas. The majority of the North Island is farm land, ranging from flat or rolling farm land through to rough and rugged lands, especially in the East Cape and King Country regions. In the west of the island is <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Famous_Mountains/#Mount_Taranaki_/_Mount_Egmont">Mount Taranaki</a>, a perfectly shaped volcano surrounded by flat farm land. </p><p>The west of the South Island is known for its great landscapes, with the Southern Alps forming the backbone and complemented by numerous glaciers and fjords. <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Fiordland_National_Park/">Fiordland National Park</a> is a <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/UNESCO_World_Heritage_List/">UNESCO World Heritage site</a>, chosen because of its natural significance. Fiordland was once described by Rudyard Kipling as "one of the natural wonders of the world" and the area is extremely popular among travellers. </p><p>The eastern part is predominantly made up of grassy rolling hills, where sheep graze. Further north, there are vineyards, especially around the <strong>Marlborough</strong> region which is world famous for its wine production. Further south on the East side lies the Banks peninsula which formed as off shore volcanic islands, but which have now eroded. The craters now make up two big harbours in which dolphins can often be seen.</p><p>Thirty kilometres south of the South Island lies <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Stewart_Island/">Stewart Island</a>. Stewart Island is predominately a national park and is the most common location to see a wild kiwi bird. It has a wet climate. The hilly island is surrounded by a number of large and small islands off shore. The island is reportedly a great location for viewing the <strong>Aurora Australis</strong> (The Southern lights).</p></div><p class="screen_only"><a class="link_to_top" href="#"><img src="http://1.tpstc.com/img/arrow-green-up.gif" alt="Top"></a></p><div id="Regions"><span class="section_edit_link"><a href="/wiki_edit.cfm?title=New%5FZealand&amp;section=Regions" title="Edit section: Regions" rel="nofollow">edit</a> </span><h2>Regions</h2><p>The two main islands comprising New Zealand, which are divided into smaller regions:<br></p><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/North_Island_(New_Zealand)/">North Island</a></td><td><a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Northland_Region/" rel="nofollow">Northland</a>, <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Auckland_Region/">Auckland</a>, <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Waikato_Region/" rel="nofollow">Waikato</a>, <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Bay_of_Plenty_Region/">Bay of Plenty</a>, <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Gisborne_Region/" rel="nofollow">East Cape / Gisborne</a>, <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Hawke\'s_Bay_Region/" rel="nofollow">Hawke\'s Bay</a>, <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Taranaki_Region/">Taranaki</a>, <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Manawatu-Wanganui_Region/" rel="nofollow">Manawatu-Wanganui</a> and <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Wellington_Region/">Wellington</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/South_Island_(New_Zealand)/">South Island</a></td><td><a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Tasman_Region/">Tasman</a>, <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Nelson_Region/" rel="nofollow">Nelson</a>, <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Marlborough_Region/" rel="nofollow">Marlborough</a>, <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/West_Coast_Region/" rel="nofollow">West Coast</a>, <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Canterbury_Region/">Canterbury</a>, <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Otago_Region/">Otago</a> and <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Southland_Region/">Southland</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Several smaller islands, of which the Sub-Antarctic Islands are the least accessible to travellers:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Stewart_Island/">Stewart Island</a> - 30 kilometres south of the South Island</li><li><a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Chatham_Islands/" rel="nofollow">Chatham Islands</a> - about 800 kilometres east of the South Island</li><li>New Zealand\'s Sub-Antarctic Islands - consisting of 5 groups: Antipodes Islands, Auckland Islands, Bounty Islands, Campbell Island Group and The Snares.

Its parks and museums are unique to the country and have a distinct <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/England/">English</a> feel. This is as a result of the large numbers of English settlers who have moved here during its development. The cathedral in the centre of the city looks like it has been taken straight from the <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/United_Kingdom/">United Kingdom</a>. It is also home to a British style seaside pier. Christchurch gets many cruise ship visits during the summer months and the visitors spend lazy afternoons punting on the River Avon. <br>Christchurch was severely damaged by two earthquakes, one in September 2010 and one in February 2011, the latter killing 181 people and damaging most of the central city including the cathedral.</p><h3 id="Queenstown">Queenstown</h3><p><a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Queenstown_(New_Zealand)/">Queenstown</a> lies on the edge of <strong>Lake Wakatipu</strong> in South Island, overlooking the magnificent Southern Alps.

Most of the area is unspoilt by any human interference.</p><h3 id="Mount_Taranaki">Mount Taranaki</h3><p><a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Famous_Mountains/#Mount_Taranaki_/_Mount_Egmont">Mount Taranaki</a> (also known as Mount Egmont) is the second highest mountain on the North Island of <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/New_Zealand/">New Zealand</a>. It\'s an active volcano, but not as active as others. The last major eruption was around 1655, although a piece of the top of the mountain came down in 1855/1856. A second volcano crater has been forming at the southern flank of the mountain. Whilst from the other side it looks like an almost perfect symmetrical mountain. Due to the similarity to <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Famous_Mountains/#Mount_Fuji">Mount Fuji</a>, the area was used as a backdrop in the film <em>The Last Samurai</em> although the mountain itself was not used in the film. Since 1881 the mountain and the surrounding forest are a national park. You don\'t need to be an experienced climber to reach the summit in summer, but prepare the trip well and be prepared for the changing weather conditions of the mountain. The climb from the Stratford Plateau and return are about 9-10 hours of walking and climbing.</p><h3 id="Nelson_and_Abel_Tasman_National_Park">Nelson and Abel Tasman National Park</h3><p><a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Nelson_(New_Zealand)/">Nelson</a> is the geographical heart of the country and is known as the sunniest place in New Zealand. Although the town itself and its nearby beaches are fun, the adjacent <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Abel_Tasman_National_Park/" rel="nofollow">Abel Tasman National Park</a> is the real gem in this area. There are great (multiple) day hikes along the beaches, coastline, through forests with huge ferns and the views are awesome. You will have to travel west from Nelson by road and be transported by boat further into the park where you can walk back in a day (or more if you like). The region is also popular among skydivers.</p><h3 id="Sky_Tower">Sky Tower</h3><p>The <a href="http://www.skytower.co.nz/" class="external" title="This is an external link" rel="nofollow">Sky Tower</a> is located in downtown <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Auckland/">Auckland</a>. This large observation and telecommunications tower is over 328 metres (1,076 feet) tall making it the tallest free standing structure in the Southern Hemisphere. For the more adventurous traveller there is even an option to Sky Jump off the tower at speeds up to 85 km/hour.

After leaving Christchurch, the train travels through the fertile Canterbury Plains past the Waimakariri River along the Main South Line, to Rolleston. It then turns onto the Midland Line, which passes through the Southern Alps past the spectacular Waimakariri River gorge, via the Otira Tunnel and Arthurs Pass, and terminates in Greymouth, on the West Coast.</p><h3 id="Other_Sights_and_Activities">Other Sights and Activities</h3><div class="photo_container"><a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/photos/stream/photoID/212265/features/countries/New%20Zealand/"><img src="http://photos.travellerspoint.com/107972/thumb_QTblog20.jpg" width="200" height="133" alt="Carol dangles from the Kawarau Bridge in QUeenstown" class="photo"></a><h4>Carol dangles from the Kawarau Bridge in QUeenstown</h4><p>\xa9 All Rights Reserved <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/users/Blakei/">Blakei</a></p></div><ul><li><strong>The Catlins</strong> is an area of green rolling hills, abandoned coastline and wildlife like the albatross and rare yellow eyed penguin.

New Zealand\'s warmest months are December through March, its summer. Winter spans from June to August and mountains on the <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/South_Island_(New_Zealand)/">South Island</a> make New Zealand a popular skiing destination in this period. Most of New Zealand lies close to the coast however, resulting in mild temperatures and plenty of sunlight year round, especially the northern tip of the North Island is still nice and mild during those months. </p><p>The average summer temperature in the North Island is around 22<dfn title="-13\xb0F">-25 \xb0C</dfn>, with the South Island averaging 21<dfn title="-11\xb0F">-24 \xb0C</dfn>.  Although New Zealand does not have a large temperature range, the weather can shift suddenly and it is not uncommon to experience "4 seasons in 1 day". Still, the North Island experiences much more of a subtropical climate, especially in the upper north, while the southern half of the South Island has a relatively cool maritime climate where high summer temperatures are not that common. Temperatures can drop well below zero in winter, especially at higher elevations, while temperatures in summer have been known to rise even slightly over <dfn title="104\xb0F">40 \xb0C</dfn>, most recently in February 2011.</p><p>For more information about the current weather, check the <a href="http://www.metservice.com/national/index" class="external" title="This is an external link" rel="nofollow">metservice.com</a> website.</p></div><p class="screen_only"><a class="link_to_top" href="#"><img src="http://1.tpstc.com/img/arrow-green-up.gif" alt="Top"></a></p><div id="Getting_There"><span class="section_edit_link"><a href="/wiki_edit.cfm?title=New%5FZealand&amp;section=Getting%20There" title="Edit section: Getting There" rel="nofollow">edit</a> </span><h2>Getting There</h2><p>Being an island, there are really only two ways to get to New Zealand: boat or plane.</p><h3 id="By_Plane">By Plane</h3><p><a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Auckland_Airport/">Auckland Airport</a> (AKL) is the country\'s busiest airport, followed by <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Christchurch_International_Airport/">Christchurch International Airport</a> (CHC), which is the main airport on the South Island and has a growing number of connections to destinations in the Pacific. <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Wellington_International_Airport/">Wellington International Airport</a> and <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Queenstown_Airport/" rel="nofollow">Queenstown Airport</a> have some options as well.

Coupled with the relatively short distances it helps explain why road transport is the preferred way to travel around New Zealand. To see the entire country in detail one would need several months, however it is quite possible to see several major attractions in the space of a few weeks when travelling by car. Driving is on the left hand side of the road and petrol costs about $NZ2.10 per litre. <a href="http://exploremore.co.nz/" class="external" title="This is an external link" rel="nofollow">Explore More</a> is a cheap rental option with depots in <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Auckland/">Auckland</a> and <a href="http://www.travellerspoint.com/guide/Christchurch/">Christchurch</a> offering several car and camper types. Some of the other options to rent cars in New Zealand include the following companies:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.avis.co.nz/car-rental/avisHome/home.ac" class="external" title="This is an external link" rel="nofollow">Avis</a></li><li><a href="http://www.hertz.com" class="external" title="This is an external link" rel="nofollow">Hertz</a></li><li><a href="http://www.budget.co.nz/default.aspx" class="external" title="This is an external link" rel="nofollow">Budget</a></li><li><a href="http://www.nzrentacar.co.nz" class="external" title="This is an external link" rel="nofollow">New Zealand Rent A Car</a></li><li><a href="http://www.thrifty.co.nz" class="external" title="This is an external link" rel="nofollow">Thrifty</a></li><li><a href="http://www.acerentalcars.co.nz" class="external" title="This is an external link" rel="nofollow">Ace Rental Cars</a></li><li><a href="http://www.gorentals.co.nz" class="external" title="This is an external link" rel="nofollow">Go Rentals</a></li><li><a href="http://www.europcar.co.nz" class="external" title="This is an external link" rel="nofollow">Europcar</a></li><li><a href="http://www.omegarentalcars.com" class="external" title="This is an external link" rel="nofollow">Omega Rental Cars</a></li><li><a href="http://www.rentadent.co.nz" class="external" title="This is an external link" rel="nofollow">Rent a Dent</a></li><li><a href="http://www.rentalcarvillage.com/car-rental-newzealand.html" class="external" title="This is an external link" rel="nofollow">Rental Car Village</a></li></ul><p>Before you rent, ask the rental company if they have any relocation deals. Even in high season there can be a bottle neck of cars and campers at certain locations that the hire company is willing to offer discounted sometimes free rental to move the vehicle, possibly right to where you want to go. The only down side is the vehicle often has a time restriction, but even this is negotiable, depending on how much the rental company needs the vehicle moved. If spending more than a few months in the country many travellers find it cheaper to buy rather than rent a car. Cars can be bought cheaply enough at the start of the winter months as backpackers arrive at Auckland or Christchurch to fly home. With the influx of visitors at the start of summer the prices tend to pick up again.</p><p><strong>Hitching</strong><br>Thumbing a lift is back in vogue in New Zealand. Both single travellers and couples are often seen with their thumb out, and Kiwi\'s are a friendly bunch that are quick to pick up a traveller. A sign telling where your going will help you get that ride. Kiwi\'s are always keen to show travellers the things that they would miss otherwise.</p><h3 id="By_Bus">By Bus</h3><p>As with car transport, the distances and infrastructure make bus travel a great way to see a lot of the country inexpensively.
